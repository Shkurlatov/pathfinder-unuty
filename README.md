# Pathfinder

![Header](docs/media/project_demo.gif)

The repository contains an implementation of the Test task.

## Task conditions

Create an application in Unity that will create a simulation of building a graph
and finding the shortest path in it using Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Task requirements

Application design is at the discretion of the developer. The main thing is that
the application meets the following requirements:

* The application must be adapted to be controlled using a mobile device

* The user should be able to manually create an arbitrary graph on the screen and
run a procedure for finding the shortest path between two selected graph nodes

* Finding the shortest path between graph nodes should be implemented using
Dijkstra's algorithm

## Implementation details

Description of the application implementation with user manual:

* To create a node in the simulation, tap the screen at the point where you want
to place the node

* A node will not be created if you tap the screen too close to an existing node

* Each node is numbered in the order in which it was created

* The maximum number of nodes is limited only by screen size

* To connect two nodes to each other, touch the screen next to the desired node
and swipe, drawing a line to the next node

* As a result, a connection is formed, which will display information about the
distance between the nodes

* Nodes can be connected to each other in any arbitrary order.

* You cannot create a connection between nodes that are already connected to each other

* The "Build Graph" interface button will only be active if every node on the screen has at least one connection

* After touching the "Build Graph" button, the application enters the path search state

* To find the shortest path, touch any two nodes in turn, and the shortest path between them along the corresponding connections will be highlighted on the screen

* To return the simulation to its initial state, tap the "Restart" button

## Pathfinder algorithm

To calculate the shortest path between nodes, the program uses an almost entirely
original implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm, with one small change. Another local
variable `int[] shortestPath` has been introduced into the algorithm, which helps not
only to calculate the shortest distance, but also contains information about the
sequence of node numbers that make up the shortest path. This is what allows elements
of this path to be highlighted on the userâ€™s screen.

```csharp
   public class DijkstraAlgorithm : IPathFindingAlgorithm
   {
       public int[] FindShortestPath(int[,] graph, int source, int verticesCount)
       {
           int[] distances = new int[verticesCount];
           bool[] shortestPathTreeSet = new bool[verticesCount];
           int[] shortestPath = new int[verticesCount];

           for (int i = 0; i < verticesCount; i++)
           {
               distances[i] = int.MaxValue;
               shortestPathTreeSet[i] = false;
           }

           distances[source] = 0;

           for (int count = 0; count < verticesCount - 1; count++)
           {
               int u = MinimumDistance(distances, shortestPathTreeSet, verticesCount);
               shortestPathTreeSet[u] = true;

               for (int v = 0; v < verticesCount; v++)
               {
                   if (!shortestPathTreeSet[v] && Convert.ToBoolean(graph[u, v]) &&
                       distances[u] != int.MaxValue && distances[u] + graph[u, v] < distances[v])
                   {
                       distances[v] = distances[u] + graph[u, v];
                       shortestPath[v] = u;
                   }
               }
           }

           return shortestPath;
       }

       private int MinimumDistance(int[] distance, bool[] shortestPathTreeSet, int verticesCount)
       {
           int min = int.MaxValue;
           int minIndex = 0;

           for (int v = 0; v < verticesCount; v++)
           {
               if (shortestPathTreeSet[v] == false && distance[v] <= min)
               {
                   min = distance[v];
                   minIndex = v;
               }
           }

           return minIndex;
       }
   }
